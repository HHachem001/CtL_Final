## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **PDF Generation:** The Assistant utilizes the [PDFMake Library](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/0.1/) for document generation, ensuring efficient and accurate document creation.
- **AI Utilization:** The project leverages the [Transformer.js AI library](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) for AI functionality, enhancing the user experience.
- **PDF Extraction:** The project leverages the [Mozilla PDF.js library](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for extracting IRC Code from uploaded documents.
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Current Known Issues in Beta Version v12.023A

- A.I. Course Notes search feature is not handing off user prompt to the larger LLM
- IRC Code Extractor may not capture all Revenue Codes from the uploaded PDF
- Capital Gains calculator may has difficulty determining if there is a NSTCL or a NSTCG
- Feedback submitted by users is not forwarded to me, and it ends up in the "void" where it will never be read.
- Basic RegEx Chatbot is not as useful as the A.I. ChatBot, and it will be deprecated

  
## How was it created? What tools did you use?

- It was created with the assistance of ChatGPT, which was used for UI design and bug fixes.
- No commerically available web design tools were utilized.
- When I found myself stuck trying to debug code, I would have ChatGPT read through forum discussions to try and inference a possible solution.
- I also utilized Google Chrome's debugging and console tools to figure out where the issues were. (It proved quite useful to determine whether the LLM was loaded into cache)
- Knowlegde gained from Professor David Colarusso's course was used to build the IRC Code extractor tool, as it relies on the extensive use of regular expression logic to scrape the uploaded document for relevant terms.
