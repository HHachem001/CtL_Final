    <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-header">Technical Support and Current Known Issues</div>
        <div class="question">Why is the page slow or unresponsive?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The page may be slow or unresponsive due to the implementation of the A.I. library, which runs on your device. If the page freezes, it is likely generating a response. Patience is advised, or you can clear your browser's cache to ensure smooth interactions with the assistant.
        </div>
		<div class="question">Why is the A.I. Course Notes Search tool not functioning right?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The A.I. Course Notes Search tool uses two A.I. models to answer your questions. It uses the smaller, more limited language model to find your answer. If the confidence score is below a certain threshold, it hands off the question to the more complex AI model, which gives an answer. Currently, there is an issue where the questions gets "stuck" in the basic A.I. model is it fails to hand it off to the complex AI model. A feature is being tested that will enable you to override the basic AI model and force the handoff to the more complex AI.
